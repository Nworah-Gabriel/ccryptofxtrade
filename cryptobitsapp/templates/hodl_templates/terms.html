    </div>
    <div>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY, AS IT INVOLVES A WAIVER OF CERTAIN RIGHTS TO
        BRING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING AS A CLASS ACTION.</div>
    <div>
        <div data-bn-type="text" class="stysty">1. Notice of Claim and Dispute Resolution Period.</div>Please
        contact Hodlvault first! Hodlvault wants to address your concerns without resorting to formal legal
        proceedings, if possible. If you have a dispute with Hodlvault, then you should contact Hodlvault and a
        ticket number will be assigned. Hodlvault will attempt to resolve your dispute internally as soon as
        possible. The parties agree to negotiate in good faith to resolve the dispute (which discussions shall
        remain confidential and be subject to applicable rules protecting settlement discussions from use as
        evidence in any legal proceeding).<br><br>In the event the dispute cannot be resolved satisfactorily,
        and you wish to assert a legal claim against Hodlvault, then you agree to set forth the basis of such
        claim in writing in a “Notice of Claim,” as a form of prior notice to Hodlvault. The Notice of Claim must
        (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, (2) set forth the specific relief sought, (3)
        provide the original ticket number, and (4) include your Hodlvault account email. The Notice of Claim
        should be submitted to an email address or hyperlink provided in your correspondence with Hodlvault. After
        you have provided the Notice of Claim to Hodlvault, the dispute referenced in the Notice of Claim may be
        submitted by either Hodlvault or you to arbitration in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Section, below.
        For the avoidance of doubt, the submission of a dispute to Hodlvault for resolution internally and the
        delivery of a Notice of Claim to Hodlvault are prerequisites to commencement of an arbitration proceeding
        (or any other legal proceeding). During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you
        or Hodlvault shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator.

        <div data-bn-type="text" class="stysty">2. Agreement to Arbitrate and Governing Law. </div>You and
        Hodlvault Operators agree that, subject to paragraph 1 above, any dispute, claim, or controversy between
        you and Hodlvault (and/or Hodlvault Operators) arising in connection with or relating in any way to these
        Terms or to your relationship with Hodlvault (and/or Hodlvault Operators) as a user of Hodlvault Services
        (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and
        whether the claims arise during or after the termination of these Terms) will be determined by mandatory
        final and binding individual (not class) arbitration, except as set forth below under Exceptions to
        Agreement to Arbitrate. You and Hodlvault Operators further agree that the arbitrator shall have the
        exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including without limitation any objections with
        respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Agreement to Arbitrate, or to the arbitrability of
        any claim or counterclaim. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. THERE IS NO JUDGE OR
        JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED. There may be more limited
        discovery than in court. The arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and
        relief as a court (including, if applicable, attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award
        declaratory or injunctive relief in favour of anyone but the parties to the arbitration. The arbitration
        provisions set forth in this Section will survive termination of these Terms. Arbitration Rules. The
        arbitration shall be subject to the HKIAC Administered Arbitration Rules (HKIAC. Rules) in force when
        the Notice of Arbitration is submitted, as modified by this Section X. The arbitration will be
        administered by the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre (HKIAC). Unless the parties agree
        otherwise, there shall be only one arbitrator appointed in accordance with the HKIAC Rules. Any
        arbitration will be conducted in the English language. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration
        is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential
        findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. JUDGMENT ON ANY ARBITRAL
        AWARD MAY BE GIVEN IN ANY COURT HAVING JURISDICTION OVER THE PARTY (OR OVER THE ASSETS OF THE PARTY)
        AGAINST WHOM SUCH AN AWARD IS RENDERED. Time for Filing: ANY ARBITRATION AGAINST Hodlvault OPERATORS MUST
        BE COMMENCED BY FILING A REQUEST FOR ARBITRATION WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR, AFTER THE DATE THE PARTY ASSERTING
        THE CLAIM FIRST KNOWS OR REASONABLY SHOULD KNOW OF THE ACT, OMISSION OR DEFAULT GIVING RISE TO THE
        CLAIM; AND THERE SHALL BE NO RIGHT TO ANY REMEDY FOR ANY CLAIM NOT ASSERTED WITHIN THAT TIME PERIOD.
        THIS ONE YEAR LIMITATION PERIOD IS INCLUSIVE OF THE INTERNAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURE SET FORTH IN
        PARAGRAPH 1 OF THIS SECTION, ABOVE. THERE SHALL BE NO RIGHT TO ANY REMEDY FOR ANY CLAIM NOT ASSERTED
        WITHIN THAT TIME PERIOD. If applicable law prohibits a one-year limitation period for asserting claims,
        any claim must be asserted within the shortest time period permitted by applicable law. Process; Notice:
        The party who intends to seek arbitration after the expiration of the Dispute Resolution Period set
        forth in paragraph 1, above, must submit a request to the HKIAC in accordance with the HKIAC Rules. If
        we request arbitration against you, we will give you notice at the email address or mailing address you
        have provided. You agree that any notice sent to this email or mailing address shall be deemed effective
        for all purposes, including without limitation to determinations of adequacy of service. It is your
        obligation to ensure that the email address and/or mailing address on file with Hodlvault is up-to-date
        and accurate. Seat of Arbitration: The seat of the arbitration shall be Hong Kong. Place of Hearing: The
        location of any in-person arbitration hearing shall be Hong Kong, unless otherwise agreed to by the
        parties. Governing Law: These Terms (including this arbitration agreement) shall be governed by, and
        construed in accordance with, the laws of Hong Kong. Confidentiality. The parties agree that the
        arbitration shall be kept confidential. The existence of the arbitration, any nonpublic information
        provided in the arbitration, and any submissions, orders or awards made in the arbitration (together,
        the “Confidential Information”) shall not be disclosed to any non-party except the tribunal, the HKIAC,
        the parties, their counsel, experts, witnesses, accountants and auditors, insurers and reinsurers, and
        any other person necessary to the conduct of the arbitration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a party may
        disclose Confidential Information to the extent that disclosure may be required to fulfill a legal duty,
        protect or pursue a legal right, or enforce or challenge an award in bona fide legal proceedings. This
        confidentiality provision shall survive termination of these Terms and of any arbitration brought
        pursuant to these Terms.
